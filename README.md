#### Demo TileGrid Project

Experimenting with bit_sets and binary serialisation to help optimise tile logic in my main project "Witch Way"

Currently:
- Half the screen will be "dirt", the other half will be "stone"
- Stone can be broken by left clicking with mouse
- Levels can be switched with 1, 2 and 3.
- Saving is done by pressing O

Will be used in the future to experiment with chunk-based loading
